Task 1: Internal structure for list entries, housekeeping variables.
Create the structure, internal to the class, that will hold the bid entries. Consider what other variables are needed to help manage the list.

Task 2: Initialize housekeeping variables.
Remember to initialize the housekeeping variables in the constructor.

Task 3: Implement append logic.
Create logic to append a bid to the end of the list.

Task 4: Implement prepend logic.
Create logic to prepend a bid to the front of the list.

Task 5: Implement print logic.
Create logic to print all the bid entries in the list to the console.

Task 6: Implement remove logic.
Create logic to remove the requested bid using the bid Id passed in.
