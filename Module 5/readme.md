Hash Tables and Chaining

Task 1: Define structures to hold bids

Task 2: Initialize the structures used to hold bids

Task 3: Implement logic to free storage when class is destroyed

Task 4: Implement logic to calculate a hash value using the bid Id as the source for calculating the key

Task 5: Implement logic to insert a bid
Be sure to check for key collisions and use the chaining technique with a linked list to store the additional bids

Task 6: Implement logic to print all bids

Task 7: Implement logic to remove a bid

Task 8: Implement logic to search for and return a bid
