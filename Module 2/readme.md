Task 1: Reference the CSVParser library
In order to use the CSVParser library functionality in your program you must declare it (or "bring in") those function definitions so they will be compiled into your executable program.
 
Task 2: Define a vector data structure to hold a collection of bids.
 
Task 3: Create a data structure and add to the collection of bids.
a.	Each bid read from the input file must be stored in a Bid structure and that structure added to the vector.
 
Task 4: Define a vector to hold all the bids.
a.	Within the main() method we need a vector defined to hold all the bids returned from the loadBids() method.
 
Task 5: Complete the method call to load the bids.
 
Task 6: Loop and display the bids read.
a.	Create a loop to iterate over every bid in the vector and pass each bid instance to the displayBid() method.
b.	Define a timer variable
c.	Initialize a timer variable before loading bids
d.	Calculate elapsed time and display result
